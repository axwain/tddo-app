## Tddo App

This application is meant to be run on i3wm scratchpad.

### Motivation

I wanted to have a quick application to write pending tests and refactoring I want to do while developing applications. I also wanted for the application to not use too much system resources and that I can have it on i3's scratchpad.

### Migration

This branch is currently to hold work to migrate this application from Neutralino to Gtk4.

Work In Progress
